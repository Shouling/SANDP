# The Price of Free: Privacy Leakage in Personalized Mobile In-App Ads
The authors studied the security issue arising from personalized in-app advertising.The authors found that mobile ads delivered by some major
network, Google, are personalized based on both users' demographic and 
interst profiles, and the personalized ads can be used by the hosting apps 
to reconstruct some of the user information. Therefore, the authors concluded 
that in-app advertising can leak potentially sensitive user information to any app that hosts personalized ads.

Why the authors saied that geo-location information is a kind of noise? In my
opinions, geo-location infromation is a significant feature for ads personalization. If geo-laction infromation is ignored, the conclusion that in-app advertising can leak potentially sensitive user information may be incorrect.

For the experimential evaluation, I think the statistical results of 695 distinct personalized ads collected from 217 volunteers may not be a strong evidence of "Privacy Leakage in Personalized Mobile In-App Ads"
